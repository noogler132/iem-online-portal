# authbox-node Quickstart

The most basic level of Authbox integration gets you high-level detection of suspicious activity. If you're using Express you can get integrated in a matter of minutes.

## Installation

```
npm install --save authbox
```

## Import Authbox

```javascript
var authbox = require('authbox');
```

## Barebones Authbox Configuration

At the bare minimum, Authbox takes in an `apiKey` and a `secretKey`. You set this once by calling the configure method:

```javascript
authbox.configure({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
});
```

## Add the Authbox middleware to your app

Adding Authbox to your Express app requires 1 line of code.

```
// Assumes your Express app is in scope as app
// var express = require('express');
// var app = express();

app.use(authbox.middleware);

// If you're behind a proxy (like HAProxy or Cloudflare) be
// sure to tell Express:
// app.set('trust proxy', true);
```
