# Verdicts

After making a check call, Authbox will return a *verdict*. You don't have to take action for all of them -- they're just suggestions from Authbox for what to do. Here's the list of possible verdicts:

  * **`ALLOW`**: do nothing and allow the request
  * **`BLOCK`**: block the request.
  * **`RATE_LIMIT`**: block the request and show a rate limiting message
  * **`CONFIRMATION_CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED`**: block the request, show a message confirming that the user actually wants to do this
  * **`IDENTITY_CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED`**: block the request and ask the user for an identity challenge (2 factor auth, security question, etc. NOT password!)
  * **`BOT_CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED`**: block the request and ask the user to prove they're human (i.e. a CAPTCHA)

When the user completes an identity or bot challenge successfully, you'll need to send Authbox an `$identity_challenge_success`, `$identity_challenge_fail`, `$bot_challenge_success` or $bot_challenge_fail` action (see previous section).

In the future we'll be releasing a client-side SDK that will automate all of this if you don't want to build it yourself.

## Next steps

Now you know how to send customized actions and receive verdicts from Authbox. Some types of actions are complex and create items in your database; read [the next section](./05-creating-content.md) to learn more.
